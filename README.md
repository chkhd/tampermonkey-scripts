## Disable captions and lesson menu in Udacity classroom

`udacity-disable-cc-and-hide-menu.js`

Udacity classroom has a nasty habit of not caring if you disable the captions or not,
or if you hide the menu, there is no option to adjust this behaviour either.

Thankfully Tampermonkey exists, and it was annoying enough to warrant a remedy. CC disable code [borrowed](https://gitlab.com/zalent/khanacademy-disable-sub).
