A place where people care about other people and everyone gets along, where ingenious UX
designers create delightful experiences and everything is intuitive and fun.

## Disable captions and lesson menu in Udacity classroom

`udacity-disable-cc-and-hide-menu.js`

Udacity classroom has a nasty habit of not caring if you disable the captions or not,
or if you hide the menu, there is no option to adjust this behaviour either.

Thankfully Tampermonkey exists, and it was annoying enough to warrant a remedy. CC disable code [borrowed](https://gitlab.com/zalent/khanacademy-disable-sub).

## Disable toolbox in learning.oreilly.com

`safari-online-hide-controls.js`

The default UI has no option to hide the toolbox, and many useful features like highlights and notes are not available in reader view.

## Automatically widen the lesson videos on Linux Academy
The user can do this by hand, but the default UI resets this for every, single, video.

`linuxacademy-auto-widen-video.js`

## Automatically hide the schedule nagging box
The user can do this too, but the default UI shows it again every, single, time the user visits the course page.

`linuxacademy-hide-schedule-box.js`

## Hide marketing other annoying banners on edX
In all my years I have never felt the desire to get a verified edX certificate, it is unlikely to change.

`edx-hide-stuff.js`

## Expand repository list in Drone by default

`drone-auto-expand-repos.js`
